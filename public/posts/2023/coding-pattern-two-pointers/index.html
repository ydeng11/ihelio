<meta name="description" content="Overview
It is not easy to summarize the pattern of Two Pointers, but most likely it is used for list and linked list and the required time complexity is O(N) - the underlying pattern allows us to use Two Pointers to go through the list once to get the results.
Common usage:

Linear Structure:

Typically applied to a sorted array or linked list.
Two pointers might move in the same direction or in opposite directions.


Classic Patterns:
a. Converging Pointers (often used in sorted arrays): - Start one pointer at the beginning (left) and another at the end (right). - Move them toward each other until they meet or until some condition is satisfied. - Example: Checking if a sorted array has two numbers that sum up to a target.
b. Sliding Window: - Use two pointers to represent the start and end of a window, then &ldquo;slide&rdquo; the window through the array/sequence. - Example: Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
c. Fast and Slow Pointers (often used in linked lists): - One pointer moves twice (or more times) as fast as the other. - Useful for detecting cycles in a linked list (Floyd&rsquo;s Cycle Detection Algorithm) or finding the middle element.
Usage Scenarios:

Finding a Pair with a Given Sum/Target: Given a sorted array, determine if there&rsquo;s a pair that sums up to a target. Move the left and right pointers based on the sum comparison to the target.
Removing Duplicates: Two pointers can be used to remove duplicates from a sorted array or linked list, with one pointer iterating through and another pointing to the last non-duplicate item.
Palindrome Checking: To determine if a string or linked list is a palindrome, you can use two pointers moving from the two ends towards the center.
Max/Min Subarray/Sublist: Using the sliding window variant, find the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum or other properties.


Advantages:

Efficiency: The two-pointer technique can sometimes convert a brute force solution with time complexity O(n^2) to a more efficient O(n) solution.
Space: This method is in-place and typically uses O(1) extra space.

Merge Sorted Array You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.\nMerge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.\nThe final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.\nExample 1:\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3 Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6] Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6]. The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0 Output: [1] Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and []. The result of the merge is [1].\nExample 3:\nInput: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1 Output: [1] Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1]. The result of the merge is [1]. Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.\nConstraints:\nnums1.length == m + n nums2.length == n 0 \u003c= m, n \u003c= 200 1 \u003c= m + n \u003c= 200 -109 \u003c= nums1[i], nums2[j] \u003c= 109 Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?\nSolution:\nThey are sorted arrays, and the follow-up asks if it can be done in linear time. And the question is to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array. Intuitively we could do it zigzag.\nclass Solution: def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -\u003e None: \"\"\" Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead. \"\"\" if n == 0: return # copy nums1 since it is larger nums1_cp = nums1[:] # create three pointers p1 and p2 starting at left end p1, p2, p3 = 0, 0, 0 # when p1 and p2 are less than the size of nums1 and nums2, we continue to merge # we move p3 every iteration since we are inserting the value while p1 \u003c m or p2 \u003c n: if p2 == n: nums1[p3] = nums1_cp[p1] p1 += 1 elif p1 == m: nums1[p3] = nums2[p2] p2 += 1 elif nums1_cp[p1] \u003c= nums2[p2]: nums1[p3] = nums1_cp[p1] p1 += 1 else: nums1[p3] = nums2[p2] p2 += 1 p3 += 1 11. Container With Most Water You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).\nFind two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\nReturn the maximum amount of water a container can store.\nNotice that you may not slant the container.\nExample 1:\nInput: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] Output: 49 Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.\nExample 2:\nInput: height = [1,1] Output: 1\nConstraints:\nn == height.length 2 \u003c= n \u003c= 105 0 \u003c= height[i] \u003c= 104 Solution\nThis question asks the max size of the container and we know the size is determined by the shorter column between two end. In other words, if height[left] is less than height[right], the size could is at most height[left]*(right - left) no matter how we move height[right]\nTherefore, we could try to find a larger height[left] by moving left and check it yields a larger size. In this case, we could use Two Pointers starting at the left and right end of height.\nclass Solution: def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -\u003e int: # create two pointers at left and right end head = 0 tail = len(height) - 1 res = 0 # continue to check when two pointers are not met yet while head \u003c tail: container_len = tail - head # update the max size found res = max(res, container_len * min(height[head], height[tail])) # move tail if height[tail] is less and otherwise move head if height[head] \u003e height[tail]: tail -= 1 else: head += 1 return res 42. Trapping Rain Water Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\nExample 1:\nInput: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] Output: 6 Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.\nExample 2:\nInput: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5] Output: 9\nConstraints:\nn == height.length 1 \u003c= n \u003c= 2 * 104 0 \u003c= height[i] \u003c= 105 Solution:\nThe idea is to calculate the trapped water using the $min(left_{max}, right_{max})$ as the water will be trapped by the shorter block like [11. Container With Most Water](#11. Container With Most Water ) except we don’t move the higher block here.\nLike the dynamic programming, we will update the $left_{max}$ and $right_{max}$ but we don’t have to store all heights. The reason we need only one pass because the $left_{max}$ and $right_{max}$ will only increase when we move their pointers. If $left_i{max}",

<p>It is not easy to summarize the pattern of <strong>Two Pointers</strong>, but most likely it is used for list and linked list and the required time complexity is <code>O(N)</code> - the underlying pattern allows us to use <strong>Two Pointers</strong> to go through the list once to get the results.</p>
<p>Common usage:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Linear Structure</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Typically applied to a sorted array or linked list.</li>
<li>Two pointers might move in the same direction or in opposite directions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Classic Patterns</strong>:
a. <strong>Converging Pointers</strong> (often used in sorted arrays): - Start one pointer at the beginning (<code>left</code>) and another at the end (<code>right</code>). - Move them toward each other until they meet or until some condition is satisfied. - Example: Checking if a sorted array has two numbers that sum up to a target.
b. <strong>Sliding Window</strong>: - Use two pointers to represent the start and end of a window, then &ldquo;slide&rdquo; the window through the array/sequence. - Example: Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
c. <strong>Fast and Slow Pointers</strong> (often used in linked lists): - One pointer moves twice (or more times) as fast as the other. - Useful for detecting cycles in a linked list (Floyd&rsquo;s Cycle Detection Algorithm) or finding the middle element.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Scenarios</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding a Pair with a Given Sum/Target</strong>: Given a sorted array, determine if there&rsquo;s a pair that sums up to a target. Move the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> pointers based on the sum comparison to the target.</li>
<li><strong>Removing Duplicates</strong>: Two pointers can be used to remove duplicates from a sorted array or linked list, with one pointer iterating through and another pointing to the last non-duplicate item.</li>
<li><strong>Palindrome Checking</strong>: To determine if a string or linked list is a palindrome, you can use two pointers moving from the two ends towards the center.</li>
<li><strong>Max/Min Subarray/Sublist</strong>: Using the sliding window variant, find the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum or other properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The two-pointer technique can sometimes convert a brute force solution with time complexity O(n^2) to a more efficient O(n) solution.</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: This method is in-place and typically uses O(1) extra space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="88-merge-sorted-array"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/">88. Merge Sorted Array</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#88-merge-sorted-array">#</a></h4>
<p>You are given two integer arrays <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code>, sorted in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong>, and two integers <code>m</code> and <code>n</code>, representing the number of elements in <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Merge</strong> <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> into a single array sorted in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong>.</p>
<p>The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be <em>stored inside the array</em> <code>nums1</code>. To accommodate this, <code>nums1</code> has a length of <code>m + n</code>, where the first <code>m</code> elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last <code>n</code> elements are set to <code>0</code> and should be ignored. <code>nums2</code> has a length of <code>n</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,2,3,5,6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> [1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> [1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>nums1.length == m + n</code></li>
<li><code>nums2.length == n</code></li>
<li><code>0 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 200</code></li>
<li><code>1 &lt;= m + n &lt;= 200</code></li>
<li><code>-109 &lt;= nums1[i], nums2[j] &lt;= 109</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow up:</strong> Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in <code>O(m + n)</code> time?</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>They are sorted arrays, and the follow-up asks if it can be done in linear time. And the question is to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array. Intuitively we could do it zigzag.</p>

<p>You are given an integer array <code>height</code> of length <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <code>ith</code> line are <code>(i, 0)</code> and <code>(i, height[i])</code>.</p>
<p>Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.</p>
<p>Return <em>the maximum amount of water a container can store</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> that you may not slant the container.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> 49
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> height = [1,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>n == height.length</code></li>
<li><code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 105</code></li>
<li><code>0 &lt;= height[i] &lt;= 104</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This question asks the max size of the container and we know the size is determined by the shorter column between two end. In other words, if <code>height[left]</code> is less than <code>height[right]</code>, the size could is at most <code>height[left]*(right - left)</code> no matter how we move <code>height[right]</code></p>
<p>Therefore, we could try to find a larger <code>height[left]</code> by moving <code>left</code> and check it yields a larger size. In this case, we could use <strong>Two Pointers</strong> starting at the left and right end of <code>height</code>.</p>

<p>Given <code>n</code> non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is <code>1</code>, compute how much water it can trap after raining.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png"></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 9</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>n == height.length</code></li>
<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 2 * 104</code></li>
<li><code>0 &lt;= height[i] &lt;= 105</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>The idea is to calculate the trapped water using the $min(left_{max}, right_{max})$ as the water will be trapped by the shorter block like [11. Container With Most Water](#11. Container With Most Water ) except we don&rsquo;t move the higher block here.<br>
Like the dynamic programming, we will update the $left_{max}$ and $right_{max}$ but we don’t have to store all heights.
The reason we need only one pass because the $left_{max}$ and $right_{max}$ will only increase when we move their pointers. If $left_i{max}&lt;right_j{max}$ at point $i$, and $j$, we should expect $left_i{max}&lt;right_i{max}$.</p>

<p>As one kind of list, <strong>Two Pointers</strong> could also be used for linked list, though sometimes we call it <strong>Two Runners</strong>. The idea is to have a slow and a fast runner. Normally when fast runner finishes, the slow runner is at the middle of the linked list which is useful.</p>
<h5 id="876-middle-of-the-linked-list"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/">876. Middle of the Linked List</a><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#876-middle-of-the-linked-list">#</a></h5>
<p>Given the <code>head</code> of a singly linked list, return <em>the middle node of the linked list</em>.</p>
<p>If there are two middle nodes, return <strong>the second middle</strong> node.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,4,5]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The middle node of the list is node 3.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,5,6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of nodes in the list is in the range <code>[1, 100]</code>.</li>
<li><code>1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>When length is odd, the fast runner will finish at the end of the list and the slow runner is at the middle point</li>
<li>When length is even, the fast runner will finish right after the end of the list and the slow runner is at the start of the second half list</li>
</ul>
