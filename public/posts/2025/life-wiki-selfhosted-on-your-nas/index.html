Introduction
I used Notion for a couple of years and found it to be one of the best tools for note-taking and building a personal wiki. Why did I stop using it? It wasn&rsquo;t about the cost—Notion&rsquo;s freemium plan is perfectly sufficient for personal use. Instead, there were two main issues that drove me away.
First, typing math equations in Notion is cumbersome because you have to use a dedicated &ldquo;Block&rdquo; for them. Second, it&rsquo;s difficult to export or migrate your data to other platforms, which, while not entirely Notion&rsquo;s fault, still concerns me. Most importantly, I realized I should make better use of my Synology NAS. That&rsquo;s why I decided to explore open-source, self-hosted alternatives.">

Most importantly, I realized I should make better use of my Synology NAS. That’s why I decided to explore open-source, self-hosted alternatives.\nChoices To my surprise, there are more choices in the market than I could imagine in the beginning.\napp name collaboration cross platform self-hosted server browser app knowledge management selfhost score Silverbullets N Y Y Y ⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ StandardNotes N Y Y Y ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐ Siyuan N Y N N ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐ Bookstack N Y Y Y ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Obsidian N Y N N ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐ LogSeq N Y N N ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Trilium N Y Y Y ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Joplin N Y Y N ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ UseMemos N Y Y Y ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Wiki.js N Y Y Y ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Appflowy Y Y Y N ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐ Affine Y Y Y Y ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐ AnyType Y Y Y N ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐ Docmost Y Y Y Y ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Outline Y Y Y Y ⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐ I tested each self-hosted tool at a basic level to see if it met my needs. Two must-have features for me are collaboration and a lightweight browser-based interface. Lastly, I’m looking at how easy it is to self-host and how truly they are self-hosted. Here’s my shortlist:\nAffine – I ruled this out because it doesn’t feel truly open source or self-hosted. There are ongoing GitHub discussions about this point. Docmost – It seems promising, but the community is still at an early stage. Outline – I ended up selecting Outline because it provides all the features I need and has a strong community. However, hosting it wasn’t straightforward—it enforces a specific authentication process, which took me a couple of days to figure out. I also tried Appflowy and AnyType, both of which came close to meeting my requirements. However, Appflowy imposes many limitations on self-hosting, and AnyType is resource-heavy, requiring MongoDB, Minio, and multiple sync nodes. By contrast, Outline can simply use a local filesystem, which has worked very well for me so far.\nSelfhost Outline \u0026 Authenlia I chooses to use Authenlia as the authentication service for Outline as I need a lightweight solution given it will only be accessed by my family and again I can use the local filesystem to power Authenlia.\nAuthenlia To host Authenlia, we need create the configuration.yml:\nlog: level: info server: address: 'tcp://:9091/' session: name: authelia_session same_site: lax secret: \"redacted\" expiration: 3600 inactivity: 300 cookies: - domain: \"your.domain\" authelia_url: \"https://your.auth.domain\" default_redirection_url: \"https://www.your.outline.domain\" name: \"authelia_session\" same_site: \"lax\" inactivity: \"5m\" expiration: \"1h\" remember_me: \"1d\" access_control: default_policy: one_factor rules: [] storage: encryption_key: \"redacted\" local: path: /config/db.sqlite3 identity_providers: oidc: hmac_secret: \"redacted\" jwks: - key: {{ secret \"/config/private.pem\" | mindent 10 \"|\" | msquote }} clients: - id: \"unique client id\" description: \"Outline Wiki\" secret: \"redacted\" public: false authorization_policy: one_factor redirect_uris: - \"https://your.outline.domain/auth/oidc.callback\" scopes: - \"openid\" - \"offline_access\" - \"profile\" - \"email\" userinfo_signed_response_alg: \"none\" token_endpoint_auth_method: \"client_secret_post\" notifier: disable_startup_check: false filesystem: filename: \"/config/notification.txt\" authentication_backend: file: path: /config/user_database.yml identity_validation: reset_password: jwt_secret: \"redacted\" jwt_lifespan: \"5 minutes\" jwt_algorithm: \"HS256\" You could run openssl rand -hex 32 to generate the key for the redacted place above.\nYou also need create a hash of the password using docker run --rm -it authelia/authelia:latest authelia crypto hash generate argon2 which prompt for your password. After you have the hash, you could go ahead creating the user_database.yml file storing the login data:\nusers: admin: displayname: \"Foo Poo\" password: \"the hash generated from above command\" email: \"email\" groups: - admins - dev When you login, you need use admin as the user name and the password you typed in to generate the hash. It is not the password and email you used under admin stanza above. And you don’t have to create many users since Outline doesn’t support multiple workspaces in selfhosted version (discussions).\nThe last one is the jwks key we could generate with the command:\ndocker run --rm -v \"$(pwd)\":/output authelia/authelia:latest authelia crypto certificate rsa generate --directory /output which will generate private.pem and public.crt at present directory and we only need private.pem here.\nAfter we have all the files ready, we could create the docker-compose.yaml:\nservices: authelia: image: authelia/authelia:4.38 container_name: authelia restart: unless-stopped environment: - TZ=UTC - X_AUTHELIA_CONFIG_FILTERS=template ports: - \"9095:9091\" volumes: # this mounted folder should have all three files you just created: # configuration.yml, user_database.yaml and private.pem - '/your/folder/authelia/config:/config' Outline This is my docker-compose.yaml hosting Outline on my NAS:\nversion: \"3.7\" services: outline: image: outlinewiki/outline:0.81.1 # this is to give Outline container the permission to access the mounted folder, which could # be different for you. You could use `ls -nd` to check the UID and GID for a particular folder user: \"1026:100\" ports: - \"3002:3000\" depends_on: - postgres - redis volumes: - /yours/outline/storage:/var/lib/outline/data networks: - npm_network environment: NODE_ENV: production SECRET_KEY: \"key generated using openssl rand -hex 32\" UTILS_SECRET: \"key generated using openssl rand -hex 32\" # HTTP # URL must be the same one used in your authenlia configuration.yml URL: https://your.outline.domain PORT: 3000 FORCE_HTTPS: true WEB_CONCURRENCY: 1 # Rate limiter RATE_LIMITER_ENABLED: true RATE_LIMITER_DURATION_WINDOW: 60 RATE_LIMITER_REQUESTS: 600 # Authentication OIDC_CLIENT_ID: \"must be the same as the one used in authenlia\" OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET: \"must be the same as the one used in authenlia\" # The OIDC config can be found from https://your.auth.domain/.well-known/openid-configuration OIDC_AUTH_URI: https://your.auth.domain/api/oidc/authorization OIDC_TOKEN_URI: https://your.auth.domain/api/oidc/token OIDC_USERINFO_URI: https://your.auth.domain/api/oidc/userinfo OIDC_LOGOUT_URI: https://your.outline.domain OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM: username OIDC_SCOPES: openid offline_access profile email # Storage FILE_STORAGE: local FILE_STORAGE_LOCAL_ROOT_DIR: /var/lib/outline/data FILE_STORAGE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE: 1086214400 # Database DATABASE_URL: postgres://user:pass@postgres:5432/outline PGSSLMODE: disable # Redis REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379 # Other LOG_LEVEL: info ENABLE_UPDATES: true DEFAULT_LANGUAGE: en_US redis: image: redis:7.4.1 expose: - 6379 networks: - npm_network command: redis-server postgres: image: postgres:12.22 expose: - 5432 networks: - npm_network environment: POSTGRES_USER: user POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass POSTGRES_DB: outline volumes: - /volume1/docker/outline/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data networks: # we need use bridge so Nginx could forward the traffic npm_network: driver: bridge This should get your Outline up and running and the last is to configure the proxy host at the NPM (aka. Nginx Proxy Manager) so we could access it from internet.\nNginx Proxy Manager You can easily create an SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt through Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM). When generating the certificate, make sure it includes both domains used to reach Outline and Authenlia (for example, your.outline.domain and your.auth.domain). You might also want to create a certificate for your top-level domain if needed. After that, simply create proxy hosts for each domain, ensuring they point to the correct internal addresses.\nUse http scheme for the destinations otherwise you prob will see 502 error. At least I have to use http scheme here and it will be secure since we enforce HTTPS on server side and use SSL cert for the connection.\nRegarding the destination address, I tried to use service:port since they are all on bridge network but unfortunately it doesn’t work for me. I have to use the nas-ip:host-port to access it. Finally, remember to forward ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) from your router to NPM. This ensures all inbound web traffic is properly routed through Nginx Proxy Manager, allowing it to forward the traffic from internet.\nConclusion I recently migrated all my notes from Notion and Obsidian to Outline and couldn’t be happier so far. This document is the first I’ve created post-migration, and the experience has been smooth—especially Outline’s robust Markdown support for math equations. The one drawback I’ve noticed is the lack of a birds-eye view, which makes it cumbersome to manage numerous documents solely from the sidebar. Fortunately, there’s ongoing discussion about adding database support, which could help create a customized homepage and improve overall organization.\n",

<p>I tested each self-hosted tool at a basic level to see if it met my needs. Two must-have features for me are collaboration and a lightweight browser-based interface. Lastly, I&rsquo;m looking at how easy it is to self-host and how truly they are self-hosted. Here&rsquo;s my shortlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affine – I ruled this out because it doesn&rsquo;t feel truly open source or self-hosted. There are ongoing GitHub discussions about this point.</li>
<li>Docmost – It seems promising, but the community is still at an early stage.</li>
<li>Outline – I ended up selecting Outline because it provides all the features I need and has a strong community. However, hosting it wasn&rsquo;t straightforward—it enforces a specific authentication process, which took me a couple of days to figure out.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also tried Appflowy and AnyType, both of which came close to meeting my requirements. However, Appflowy imposes many limitations on self-hosting, and AnyType is resource-heavy, requiring MongoDB, Minio, and multiple sync nodes. By contrast, Outline can simply use a local filesystem, which has worked very well for me so far.</p>
<h1 id="selfhost-outline--authenlia">Selfhost Outline &amp; Authenlia<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#selfhost-outline--authenlia">#</a></h1>
<p>I chooses to use <code>Authenlia</code> as the authentication service for <code>Outline</code> as I need a lightweight solution given it will only be accessed by my family and again I can use the local filesystem to power <code>Authenlia</code>.</p>
<h2 id="authenlia">Authenlia<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#authenlia">#</a></h2>
<p>To host Authenlia, we need create the <code>configuration.yml</code>:</p>

<h2 id="nginx-proxy-manager">Nginx Proxy Manager<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nginx-proxy-manager">#</a></h2>
<p>You can easily create an SSL certificate with <code>Let's Encrypt</code> through Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM). When generating the certificate, make sure it includes both domains used to reach Outline and Authenlia (for example, <code>your.outline.domain</code> and <code>your.auth.domain</code>). You might also want to create a certificate for your top-level domain if needed. After that, simply create proxy hosts for each domain, ensuring they point to the correct internal addresses.</p>
<p>Use http scheme for the destinations otherwise you prob will see 502 error. At least I have to use http scheme here and it will be secure since we enforce HTTPS on server side and use SSL cert for the connection.</p>
<p>Regarding the destination address, I tried to use <code>service:port</code> since they are all on bridge network but unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t work for me. I have to use the <code>nas-ip:host-port</code> to access it. Finally, remember to forward ports <strong>80</strong> (HTTP) and <strong>443</strong> (HTTPS) from your router to NPM. This ensures all inbound web traffic is properly routed through Nginx Proxy Manager, allowing it to forward the traffic from internet.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h1>
<p>I recently migrated all my notes from <code>Notion</code> and <code>Obsidian</code> to <code>Outline</code> and couldn&rsquo;t be happier so far. This document is the first I&rsquo;ve created post-migration, and the experience has been smooth—especially <code>Outline</code>&rsquo;s robust Markdown support for math equations. The one drawback I&rsquo;ve noticed is the lack of a birds-eye view, which makes it cumbersome to manage numerous documents solely from the sidebar. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s ongoing discussion about adding database support, which could help create a customized homepage and improve overall organization.</p>
