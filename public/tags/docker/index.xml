      <title>Life Wiki Selfhosted on Your NAS</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Notion for a couple of years and found it to be one of the best tools for note-taking and building a personal wiki. Why did I stop using it? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t about the costâ€”Notion&amp;rsquo;s freemium plan is perfectly sufficient for personal use. Instead, there were two main issues that drove me away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, typing math equations in Notion is cumbersome because you have to use a dedicated &amp;ldquo;Block&amp;rdquo; for them. Second, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to export or migrate your data to other platforms, which, while not entirely Notion&amp;rsquo;s fault, still concerns me. Most importantly, I realized I should make better use of my Synology NAS. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to explore open-source, self-hosted alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Build a home media server but automated</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://ihelio.today/archives/howtoroutetransmissiontovpncontainer&#34;&gt;Route transmission to VPN container&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about how to download contents via VPN tunnel so we can get rid of some troubles. But that is far from enough for us to build a home media server which should work as Netflix and Hulu to us. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother with the torrent and subtitle search. Once we add a show to our watch list, everything should be set up automatically. I will introduce the tools and necessary setup for me to build a home media server in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to route transmission to VPN container?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a NAS at home, it feel bad if you don&amp;rsquo;t keep it running for something even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use it. It is the major backup to store the photos we shoot with our iphones. However, it is just basic use and hosting a media center with it sounds more cool. I used to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn&#34;&gt;transmission-openvpn&lt;/a&gt; and it works perfectly, however, my VPN expires and I decided to use proton free tier. This is where things go south - I spent two days on it and I cannot get it work. When I am about to give up, I found a better approach for my purpose - running transmission and vpn in separate docker container and route transmission to vpn conatiner. It sounds a great idea in the first place given we should only do one job for each service - unix&amp;rsquo;s princinple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
