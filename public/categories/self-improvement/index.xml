      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I started using Obsidian as my knowledge management and writing tool, it is a pain for me to manage my posts for my blog. I used to write it in the Obsidian and copied it over to the repo of my blog. If I make changes, I need to update it twice which is very tedious and error-prone. So I started to find a solution allowing me to write and store my posts at one place and continue to use Hugo to build my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
