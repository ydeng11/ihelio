      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally we don&amp;rsquo;t have to use SSL when we connect to the services via Tailscale as all connections are end-to-end encrypted and only allowed users could access your network. But there are always exceptions like you want put your tailscale domain behind a public domain or you have to use SSL for internal connections. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder&#34;&gt;horader&lt;/a&gt; on ios requires the SSL and it won&amp;rsquo;t work when we host hoarder using docker even we enable HTTPS on tailscale DNS and add cert to the NAS. When I access hoarder via the tailscale of the NAS, it always returns insecure connection. I tried created the SSL cert using &lt;code&gt;tailscale cert&lt;/code&gt; and make it the default cert of my Synology, it still fails as tailscale cert only cover the port 443 so the services running at other ports are not covered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
