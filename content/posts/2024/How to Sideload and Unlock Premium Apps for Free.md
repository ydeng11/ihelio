Google, like many large tech companies, has tightened its grip on profits, making it increasingly difficult for customers to find affordable workarounds. The days of using a VPN to pay for discounted YouTube or Spotify Premium are mostly over. Without a locally issued card, paying for premium services remotely is nearly impossible, with Kazakhstan being the sole exception. While virtual cards like Wise and Revolut can bypass some checks, the process is cumbersome and carries its own risks.

But here’s the silver lining: **Sideloading**. Sideloading lets you install apps (IPA files) from sources outside the App Store, enabling you to access advanced, ad-free versions of apps like YouTube and Spotify for free. And since the tools and code used are open source, the process is generally safe and transparent.

## Getting Started with Sideloading

There are several ways to sideload IPA files, but **Sideloadly** stands out for its simplicity. Here’s how you can get started:

1. **Download Sideloadly**: Visit their [official website](https://sideloadly.io/) and install the app.
2. **Follow the Instructions**: The step-by-step guide provided by Sideloadly makes the process straightforward.
3. **Choose Your Apps**: I recommend these two:
   - [**YTLitePlus**](https://github.com/YTLitePlus/YTLitePlus): A feature-rich, ad-free YouTube client.
   - [**EeveeSpotify**](https://github.com/whoeevee/EeveeSpotify): An enhanced version of Spotify with premium features.

## Sideloading for Apple TV

If you’re looking to sideload apps on Apple TV, Sideloadly works just as well. Alternatively, you can connect to a VPN in Albania, where ads are legally banned, for a seamless, ad-free experience.

## Why Sideloading?

Sideloading isn’t just a workaround—it’s a way to reclaim control over your devices. By using open-source tools and apps, you can customize your experience and access premium features without recurring fees. While it requires a bit of effort upfront, the payoff is a fully functional, cost-free solution to otherwise expensive subscriptions.
