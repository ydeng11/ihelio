Negotiation is not easy. It requires you to very persistent, deteministic and knowledgable. Negotiation with dealer is probably even more difficlut to most normal people because of the asymmetric information. You only know what they let you know and you have to negotiate with that limited information, which puts us at a disadvantageous position. What's more, the dealers will try their best preventing us acquring these information with many unspoken rules I will elaborate later. However, that doesn't mean there is nothing we can do about it and we still can get us a fair deal if we can have some patience and strategy.

# Never Commit
If you are new to the dealer, one common stragety of them is to give you a market adjustment and tell you they can cross that off you can make commitment to take the car today. This looks deliciaous but also toxic. When I bought my last car when I was still in school, I didn't get away from it because it looks so tempting.

But we just need take a step back and think about it, we will know it comes too easy and too early. Though I don't have any statiscs for it, I will have to state that 95% of us need a long road to get the end. If you insist you have to commit to continue this discussion, they are pushing very hard and we don't have any room to dodge. I will just leave in that situation. 

Ironically, they probably will pause their attack, calm you down and talk about some other stuff like how good this car is blablabla. Even more, they will go to their manager and come back to you with shaking voice, "my manager gave you the best offer I've never seen, $5000 off from this number, but only today". It will make you feel so impressed and you probally wanna make a deal right away before it slips. Here we are again, just calm down, look at the numbers and start our second stargety - Do the math.

# Do the Math
If you wanna save money, do the math. And you don't have to a mathmatician for that, all you need is to google a [auto loan calculator](https://www.calculator.net/auto-loan-calculator.html). Now you could check the total value of the deal inculding trade-in and interest. This is where most people might overlook in the negotiagtion including myself in my last car purchase experience - as a PhD student, I only have $1,200 on my paycheck so I cannot afford a car asking $500 monthly payment thus lowing the monthly payment is one of my pain point which makes me pay much more than I thought. 

If you look at all the finance options, you will find the APR would go up with more terms. It makes sense since the lender takes more risk and more time to collect the debt, for sure they wanna their cake grow bigger along the time. And the dealer also wanna sell you long term options (e.g. 60 months plus) by talking about the lower monthly payemnt and hiding the APR from you. So this is the time we should do the math and make sure we know all the pains and gains from the deal. Regarding the APR, normally there are finance offer from the manufacture's website like Mazda is offering 2.49% for up to 36 months when I am writing this article in September 2022. DCU is also another good place to shop lower rates as well.

# Be patient
Never rush yourself in a negotiation or you will pay for it. When I am looking for a new car, I went to three local dealers for their quote which took time and energy. It will be overwhelming so you don't have to do it on the same day and you could do it over a weekend to collect the information you would need:
1. The retailing price
	1. Sticker price
	2. Dealer package - this normally includes some lifetime service like carwash and tire nitrogen but only for the dealer where you purhcase the car
	3. Markup
	4. Any manufacture rebates you are qualified - dealer won't ask and you have to do your homework beforehand and you can always find this from manufacture's website
	5. And discounts from dealter - this will be really difficult in this market and I didn't get one but it never hurt for you to try
2. The trade-in value
	1. We could do it online with Carvana and Vroom to get a quote before walking into the dealership and this will be our negotiation weapon
	2. Let the dealer know you have trade-in offer at the hand and normally they will honor these quotes (remember most dealers won't honor KBB with so many reasons) and we can pressue them a bit
	3. Try to get a copy or screen shoe of the OTD (out the door) price quote which can be used for you to negotiate at other places. For exeample, you got a better trade-in at A and a discount at B, if you could make B match the trade-in, you got yourself a better deal. And written evidence will help them to meet you there
3. Finace options
	1. As I have mentioned in **Do the Math**, you could easily pay much more than you thought if you didn't choose the right finance options. I suggest you to reduce the terms to your best.
	2. Don't leave this part completely to the dealer, it is better to have something at your hand and you always have an alternative to use if the dealer offer is not good.
	3. Though some people would argue about refinancing later, I would say it is better to land on a good deal in the beginning because you never want to time the market especially now.
With all the info above collected, you could further choose the following stragtegy to maxmize your benefits:
1. Extend your search
	1. Don't limit yourself in local - try to extend your search region to all drivable area if you have trade-in or you need drive it back home yourself
	2. The dealers could have very different rules even they are just hundreds miles away - it is much easier to waive the dealer package if you live hundereds miles away and they are more willing to give you a trade-in apprasiver over the email
3. Make dealers compete
	1. It is 2022, don't believe story of the chip shortage and production shortage any more. Be deteministic that you shouldn't pay any markup for any car now. If they insist, just walk away to another dealer.
	2. Show them what you got and tell them to show you better to make this deal.

# Conclusion
To get yourself a good deal, all you need is to be patient, do the math and never commit for these baits. All these suggestions come from my recent experience which took me a week to get my car. Before I started, I read some guidance online and I found them not very helpful at this momemnt so I decide to share what I learned from it.
